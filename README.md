Hi, I'm @VishChandran. Coding has been my past time hobby outside my project management profession. Not a hardcore coder but have always loved the logic formulation behind coding. Firm believer that debugging happens the best after a shower or a quick walk. Looking to drop in few of my projects here that I'm currently doing in freeCodecamp and further build on them.
